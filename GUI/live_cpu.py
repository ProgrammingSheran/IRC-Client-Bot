This file represents the CPU state included in the GUI
This is a live CPU state showing up in the GUI in form of
a so called ProgressBar.
There's a Live_CPU class which is inheriting from QThread class.
There a several error and critical CPU catchings built-in.
So in case of an error or critical CPU states the GUI will warn you
or exit exit if the CPU exceeds a certain value!
